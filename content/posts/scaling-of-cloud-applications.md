One topic we haven't coverd yet is `scaling of cloud applications`. Platforms such as AWS, Azure, and GCP supports scaling on some of their products, which we will cover later. When utilizing a cloud service provider that supports either `Horizontal Scaling` or `Vertical Scaling` it should be utilized but only if they are needed.  
Today we will both cover what type of scaling methods exists, and how Azure Functions might scale for you.
We will utilize our action function written in [Serverless Functions with Jenkins](https://blog.letnh.com/serverless-functions-with-jenkins/), to stress this application we will utilize [Locust](https://locust.io/) which is a Open Source load testing tool written in python, more on that later.
