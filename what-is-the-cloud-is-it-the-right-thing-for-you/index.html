<h1>What is the cloud? Is it the right thing for you?</h1>

</header><p>The cloud can be many things, and it&rsquo;s a big subject. Cloud is often called &ldquo;someone else&rsquo;s computer&rdquo;, which it is to some extent. But today we will discuss the subject cloud a bit and give you a brother understanding of what it is and what the pros and cons are.</p>
<h2 id=what-is-the-cloud>What is the cloud?</h2>
<p>You might think that the cloud is just one server that someone owns, which isn&rsquo;t true. The cloud is most time a vast network of remote servers connected. To give both better performance, latency, and speed for users.
When you talk about cloud, you can either talk about Private-, public cloud, etc.</p>
<h3 id=lets-start-with-the-public-cloud>Let&rsquo;s start with the public cloud!</h3>
<p>Public clouds are accessible through the internet, by anyone, and at any time.
Public cloud servers are available through 3rd-party companies such as Microsoft, Amazon, Hetzner, DigitalOcean, for anyone to buy/rent. The main difference to self-hosting is that you only pay for what resources you use.</p>
<h3 id=so-what-is-private-cloud>So what is private cloud?</h3>
<p>Private clouds are next to the same as public clouds but are restricted to only selected users/parties to access those resources. This may be possible through VPN (Virtual Private Network), Site to Site VPN, or internal network.<br>
In most situations when you buy/rent a private cloud at a 3rd-party company you as a customer is responsible for maintenance regarding your infrastructure, but that depends on the cloud provider. (Private cloud can also be called on-prem)</p>
<h2 id=what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-using-the-cloud>What are the pros and cons of using the cloud?</h2>
<p>The cloud has both pros and cons just as anything else has, and may also be different between providers depending on what they provide and cost.</p>
<h3 id=whats-the-pros>Whats the pros?</h3>
<ul>
<li>No downtime, near 0% downtime.</li>
<li>No maintenance of infrastructure.</li>
<li>Easier and more affordable scaling.</li>
<li>Flexible and pay as you go.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id=to-good-to-be-true-are-there-any-cons>To good to be true, are there any cons?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Can be expensive depending on the provider.</li>
<li>If the provider has a security breach you could also be affected, a recent security vulnerability is <a href=https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644161/microsoft-azure-database-vulnerabilty-chaosdb>Azure cosmos DB vulnerability - theverge</a></li>
<li>Too much to choose from.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=pricing-conclusion>Pricing conclusion!</h2>
<p>For this short comparison, I took and compared the price for a VM with 2 vCPU, 8GB Ram, and ~10GB storage.
The list is sorted on expensive first and cheapest last <em>not performance, favorites</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Azure: $100.06/Month</li>
<li>GCP: $53.81/Month</li>
<li>AWS: $32.79/Month</li>
<li>DigitalOcean: ~$48/Month</li>
<li>Linode: $23/Month</li>
<li>Hetzner: $12.57/Month</li>
</ul>
<h2 id=conclusion>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The cloud might be something for you, or maybe not. There are a lot of other aspects that I haven&rsquo;t included, due to both lengths and we could talk for days about this.
But one thing to remember is that <em>you get what you pay for</em> when using one of the smaller/cheaper providers you may only get a VM with Linux installed, but if you use AWS, GCP you have support for other services such as firewalls, VPN, serverless servers, anthos, etc.</p>
