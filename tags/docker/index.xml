We will use Golang with Golang Templates to serve a static site to the user, and then build it into a super small container!
Lets check the code! Like I said earlier this is a simple golang web app, that serves a html template with GeoIP information.</description></item><item><title>CosmosDB With Serverless app</title><link>https://blog.letnh.com/cosmosdb-with-serverless-app/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 20:51:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.letnh.com/cosmosdb-with-serverless-app/</guid><description>Before you contiune further I will just stop you a second. I recomend you read truough my other blog post about Serverless functions with Jenkins. I will skip over the main focus things with did there, to save your time.
We will create a simple serverless REST API that&amp;rsquo;s shows releases for an application. The app is written in .NET and will utilize Cosmos DB.
The code! This is fairly simular to the last azure function with did, with python which you can read here.</description></item><item><title>Serverless Functions With Jenkins</title><link>https://blog.letnh.com/serverless-functions-with-jenkins/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Sep 2021 20:51:46 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.letnh.com/serverless-functions-with-jenkins/</guid><description>What is Serverless and FaaS? FaaS or Functions as a service is just a subset of serverless.
Serverless is focused on both compute, messaging, gateways, databases, and of course functions. Instead of setting up your own, message broker and then write a service that listens on it, you could just write a function and deploy it to Azure, IBM, or AWS, etc.
When you are using FaaS you can choose when the function should trigger, if it&amp;rsquo;s on an HTTP request, message, timer, etc.</description></item><item><title>Docker Build Ci</title><link>https://blog.letnh.com/docker-build-ci/</link><pubDate>Tue, 14 Sep 2021 19:39:56 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://blog.letnh.com/docker-build-ci/</guid><description>Currently the industry is moving towards containerization and orchestration more.

Why &amp;amp; What? CI is popular for almost any project regardless the size of it. Instead of building or testing your code manually. It can be triggerd on commits to specific branch in your version control.</description></item><item><title>What is the cloud?
